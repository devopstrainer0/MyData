Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are software engineering practices that aim to minimize the time taken between writing code and its deployment to production. Jenkins is a popular open-source tool that provides a platform to automate the CI/CD pipeline. In this article, we will explain how to set up a basic CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, including all the stages involved.

Prerequisites
Before setting up the CI/CD pipeline, the following must be in place:

A version control system (VCS) like Git
A Jenkins server with necessary plugins installed
A build environment to compile the code
A deployment environment to deploy the code

Step 1: Create a Jenkins Job
A Jenkins job is a collection of tasks that define what Jenkins should do in order to build, test, and deploy a particular project. To create a new job, follow these steps:

Log in to the Jenkins server
Click on the "New Item" link
Enter a name for the job and select "Pipeline" as the job type
Click on the "OK" button

Step 2: Configure the VCS
In this step, we will configure the version control system (VCS) in Jenkins.

In the "Source Code Management" section, select the VCS that you are using (e.g., Git)
Enter the repository URL
Enter the credentials for accessing the repository (if necessary)

Step 3: Define the Jenkinsfile
A Jenkinsfile is a script that defines the entire CI/CD pipeline in Jenkins. This script is stored in the VCS repository and is used by Jenkins to automatically build, test, and deploy the code.

In the "Pipeline" section, select "Pipeline script" as the definition type
Enter the following code to define a basic CI/CD pipeline:

pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building...'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Testing...'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying...'
            }
        }
    }
}

Step 4: Build the Job
With the VCS and Jenkinsfile configured, we can now build the job for the first time.

Click on the "Build Now" button
Wait for the build to complete
Check the build output to see if the build, test, and deployment stages are executed successfully
Step 5: Customize the Jenkinsfile
The Jenkinsfile provided in Step 3 is just a basic example. In a real-world scenario, you would customize it to include the necessary steps for building, testing, and deploying your code. Some of the common steps include:

Compiling the code
Running unit tests
Building a Docker image
Deploying to a production environment
Here is an example of a more advanced Jenkinsfile that includes these steps:

pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building...'
                sh 'mvn compile'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Testing...'
                sh 'mvn test'

            }
        }
        stage('Build Docker Image') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building Docker Image...'
                sh 'docker build -t myimage .'
            }
        }
        stage('Push Docker Image') {
            steps {
                echo 'Pushing Docker Image...'
                sh 'docker push myimage'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying...'
                sh 'kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml'
            }
        }
    }
}

Note that the above Jenkinsfile is just an example and may not work for your specific project. You may need to modify it to match your project's requirements.

Step 6: Monitor the Pipeline
With the CI/CD pipeline set up, you can monitor its progress and status on the Jenkins dashboard. You can see the build history, including the build number, status, and duration. If a build fails, you can examine the build output to see what went wrong and fix the issue.
